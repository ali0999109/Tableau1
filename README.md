Designing a comprehensive revenue dashboard requried four distinct worksheets: yearly, monthly, weekly, and daily. These sheets will serve as essential components in compiling and analyzing store revenue data. To enhance data interpretation and accessibility, these worksheets will be seamlessly integrated into a dynamic dashboard, providing a visual representation of the store's financial performance.
